Project Overview

This project analyzes historical sales performance for Global Superstore to identify key revenue drivers, customer behavior patterns, and long-term sales trends. The analysis combines descriptive analytics with a forward-looking sales outlook to support both operational review and strategic planning decisions.

The dashboard is designed for business stakeholders who need a clear understanding of what has happened, what is driving performance, and where sales are likely headed under stable conditions.

Dataset

Source: Global Superstore dataset

Scope: Multi-year transactional sales data

Key Fields:

Order ID

Order Date

Customer ID

City / Country

Category

Shipping Mode

Sales

A custom Date dimension was created to support time-based analysis and forecasting.

Key KPIs

The following KPIs were selected to provide a concise performance snapshot:

Total Sales – Overall revenue generated

Total Orders – Number of unique customer orders

Average Order Value (AOV) – Average revenue per order, calculated as Total Sales ÷ Total Orders

These KPIs together explain whether revenue growth is driven by order volume or order value.

Key Insights

Sales exhibit consistent year-over-year growth, with Q4 showing strong seasonal performance.

Revenue is concentrated in a small number of top-performing cities, indicating both strong regional markets and geographic concentration risk.

The Technology category is the primary revenue driver, contributing the largest share of total sales.

Customers predominantly prefer Standard Class shipping, suggesting price sensitivity outweighs delivery speed for most purchases.

Sales growth appears to be driven more by order volume than increases in AOV, highlighting the importance of customer acquisition and order frequency.

Sales Outlook & Forecast

A yearly sales projection was developed to provide a long-term strategic outlook.

The projection indicates sustained sales growth under stable market conditions.

This outlook is intended to support strategic planning and capacity discussions, not precise revenue prediction.

The forecast assumes no major changes in pricing strategy, product mix, or market structure.

Clear distinction is maintained between historical actuals and projected trends to avoid overinterpretation.

Limitations & Assumptions

The dataset does not include cost or profit data; therefore, profitability analysis was not performed.

Forecasting is based solely on historical sales trends and does not account for external market shocks, promotions, or pricing changes.

Results should be interpreted as directional insights, not guaranteed outcomes.

Tools Used

Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and forecasting

DAX – KPI and metric calculations

Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Translate raw sales data into actionable business insights

Apply appropriate aggregation and modeling techniques

Communicate uncertainty and assumptions clearly

Present analysis in a decision-oriented, executive-friendly format
